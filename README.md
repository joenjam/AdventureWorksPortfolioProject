4.	Dashboard presentation.
5.	Share insights and make recommendations.
### PHASE 1: DATA EXPLORATION AND VALIDATION
Data exploration was done in SQL server on the tables highlighted earlier for the purpose of the analysis. The following were the observations made;
-	Null values were present in the CurrencyRateID column in the Sales.SalesOrderHeader, though ignored as the column was irrelevant to the analysis.
-	The UnitPriceDiscount column in the Sale.SaleOrderDetail has a 0.00 value all through. 
-	In the Sales.Sales. Customer table Null values were observed in the PersonID column however, these were ignored because it is assumed that some customers names were not captured and also it will not affect the analysis. 
-	In the Production.Product table the Color column had Null values this was ignored since the column is not useful to the analysis, the Size column had a mixture of values that included Nulls, abbreviations and numerals, this also was ignored for same reason as above, the SizeUnitMeasureCode column is comprised of Nulls and a mixture of units both in pounds and grams as above also ignored. Other columns with Nulls are Class, Style, ProductSubcategory, EndDate and DiscontinuedDate which were also ignored.
### PHASE 2; DATA CLEANING
-	Date data columns in the Sales.SalesOrderHeader table were stripped of timestamps
-	Codes in CountyRegionCode column in the Sales.SalesTerritory table were converted from abbreviations to full country names.
-	Null values in the SubcategoryName column in the Production.ProductSubcategory table and CategoryName columns in the Production.ProductCategory table were converted to N/A.
-	Name column values in the Purchasing.ShipMethod table were converted to short but descriptive names.
